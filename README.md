# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A Machine Learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization to identify potentially fraudulent activities.

## Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a serious issue in the financial sector. This project aims to create a predictive model that can classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The model is trained on transaction data and evaluated using multiple performance metrics.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of credit card transactions, which includes features such as:
- Transaction amount
- Transaction time
- Various anonymized numerical features representing transaction behavior

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.  
2. **Model Building**: Implemented models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict fraudulent transactions.  
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
   - ROC-AUC  
4. **Visualization**: Confusion matrix and other plots to analyze model performance.  

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file: `CreditCard_Fraud_Detection.ipynb`  
2. Run all the cells sequentially.  
3. Check the results, metrics, and visualizations for model performance.  

## Key Features
- End-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.  
- Multiple machine learning models to compare performance.  
- Clear visualizations for better understanding of results.
